The design will really use the TLC272 ic. The schematic-real.sch was used in order to route all of the connections where they should go. The TLC271 was used here because it is the same size and has the same packaging as the TLC272. The TLC272 design was not used for routing becuase it lacked connection pins to GND and VCC. For some reason, the schematic for the TLC272 does not have connection pins to VCC and GND, and so those connections are not able to be connected. The TLC271 was used to correct for this design flaw.
